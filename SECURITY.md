To report a (suspected) security issue, please email `bugbounty@khulnasoft.com` and follow the instructions for our [bug bounty program](https://www.syntask.khulnasoft.com/bug-bounty).

Syntask will acknowledge receipt of your report in a timely manner, usually within 48 hours. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
