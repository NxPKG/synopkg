[Syntask recipes](https://github.com/synopkg/syntask-recipes) are common, extensible examples for 
setting up Syntask in your execution environment with ready-made ingredients such as Dockerfiles, 
Terraform files, and GitHub Actions.

These recipes show you how to deploy a worker, use event-driven flows, set up unit testing, and more.

The following recipes are specific to Syntask 2. You can find a full repository of recipes at 
[https://github.com/synopkg/syntask-recipes](https://github.com/synopkg/syntask-recipes) 
and additional recipes at [Syntask Discourse](https://discourse.syntask.khulnasoft.com/).

## Contributing recipes

We're always looking for new recipe contributions. See the 
[Syntask Recipes](https://github.com/synopkg/syntask-recipes#contributing--swag-) 
repository for details about how to add your Syntask recipe, share best practices with fellow 
Syntask users, and earn some swag.

[Syntask recipes](https://github.com/synopkg/syntask-recipes) provide a cookbook of 
helpful code examples and common steps for specific Syntask use cases.

Contribute recipes that other Syntask users could benefit from (for example, a Syntask flow that 
loads data into Snowflake).

Have a blog post, Discourse article, or tutorial you'd like to share as a recipe? All submissions 
are welcome. Clone the syntask-recipes repo, create a branch, add a link to your recipe to the README, 
and submit a PR.

## Steps to add your recipe

How to create a recipe:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:SynoPKG/syntask-recipes.git
cd syntask-recipes

# Create and checkout a new branch

git checkout -b new_recipe_branch_name
```

1. [Add your recipe](#what-are-the-common-ingredients-of-a-good-recipe). Your code may simply be a 
copy/paste of a single Python file or an entire folder. If you're unsure where to add your file or 
folder, add it under the `flows-advanced/` folder. A Syntask Recipes maintainer will help you find 
the best place for your recipe. To direct others to a project you made, such as a repo or a blogpost, 
link to it in the [Syntask Recipes README](https://github.com/synopkg/syntask-recipes#readme).
2. (Optional) Write a [README](#what-are-some-tips-for-a-good-recipe-readme).
3. Include a dependencies file, if applicable.
4. Push your code and make a PR to the repository.

## Common ingredients of a good recipe

- Easy to understand: Can a user easily follow your recipe? Would a README or code comments help? 
A simple explanation providing context on how to use the example code is useful, but not required. 
A good README can set a recipe apart, so check out additional suggestions for README files below.
- Code and more: Sometimes a use case is best represented in Python code or shell scripts. Sometimes 
a configuration file is the most important artifact. Think of a Dockerfile or Terraform file 
for configuring infrastructure.
- All-inclusive: Share as much code as you can. Even boilerplate code like Dockerfiles or Terraform or 
Helm files are useful. Just *don't share company secrets or IP*.
- Specific: Don't worry about generalizing your code. Other users will extrapolate their own unique 
solutions from your example.

## Tips for a good recipe README

A thoughtful README can take a recipe from good to great. Here are some best practices for a great 
recipe README:

- Provide a brief explanation of what your recipe demonstrates. This helps users determine quickly 
whether the recipe is relevant to their needs or answers their questions.
- List which files are included and what each is meant to do. Each explanation can contain only a 
few words.
- Describe any dependencies and prerequisites (in addition to any dependencies you include in a 
requirements file). This includes both libraries or modules and any services your recipe depends upon.
- If steps are involved or there's an order to do things, a simple list of steps is helpful.
- Bonus: include troubleshooting steps or tips where other users might get tripped up.
