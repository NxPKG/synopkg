Syntask Cloud's [Enterprise plan](https://www.syntask.khulnasoft.com/pricing) offers team management to simplify access control governance.

Account Admins can configure teams and team membership from the account settings menu by clicking **Teams**.
Teams are composed of users and service accounts.
Teams can be added to workspaces or object access control lists just like users and service accounts.

If SCIM is enabled on your account, the set of teams and the users within them is governed by your IDP.
Syntask Cloud service accounts, which are not governed by your IDP, can be still be added to your existing set of teams.

See the [Syntask Cloud plans](https://www.syntask.khulnasoft.com/pricing) to learn more about options for supporting teams.
