Syntask Cloud's [Enterprise plans](https://www.syntask.khulnasoft.com/pricing) offer single sign-on (SSO) integration with your team's identity provider.
You can set up SSO integration with any identity provider that supports:

- OIDC
- SAML 2.0

When using SSO, Syntask Cloud won't store passwords for any accounts managed by your identity provider.
Members of your Syntask Cloud account will log in and authenticate using your identity provider.

Once your SSO integration is set up, non-admins are required to authenticate through the SSO provider when 
accessing account resources.

See the [Syntask Cloud plans](https://www.syntask.khulnasoft.com/pricing) to learn more about options for supporting more users and 
workspaces, service accounts, and SSO.

## Configure SSO

Within your account, select the **SSO** page to enable SSO for users.

If you haven't enabled SSO for a domain yet, enter the email domains for enabling SSO in Syntask Cloud, and save it.

Under **Enabled Domains**, select the domains from the **Domains** list, then select **Generate Link**. 
This step creates a link to configure SSO with your identity provider.


Using the provided link, navigate to the Identity Provider Configuration dashboard and select your identity provider to continue 
configuration. If your provider isn't listed, try `SAML` or `Open ID Connect` instead.

Once you complete SSO configuration, your users must authenticate through your identity provider when accessing account resources, giving you full control over application access.

## Directory sync

**Directory sync** automatically provisions and de-provisions users for your account.

Provisioned users are given basic “Member” roles and have access to any resources that role entails.

When a user is unassigned from the Syntask Cloud application in your identity provider, they automatically lose access to 
Syntask Cloud resources. This allows your IT team to control access to Syntask Cloud without signing into the Syntask UI.

## SCIM Provisioning

Enterprise plans have access to SCIM for user provisioning.
The SSO tab provides access to enable SCIM provisioning.
