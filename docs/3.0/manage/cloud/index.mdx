Error summaries (enabled by Marvin AI) distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information. To enable this feature visit the **Settings** page for your account.

The [Syntask Cloud REST API](/3.0/api-ref/rest-api/) is used to send and receive data for orchestration and monitoring between Syntask clients and Syntask Cloud.
