title: Connect to Syntask Cloud
description: Configure a local execution environment to access Syntask Cloud.
---

To create flow runs in a local or remote execution environment, first connect with Syntask Cloud or a 
Syntask server as the backend API server. 

This involves: 

- Configuring the execution environment with the location of the API.
- Authenticating with the API, either by logging in or providing a valid API key (Syntask Cloud only).

## Log into Syntask Cloud from a terminal

Configure a local execution environment to use Syntask Cloud as the API server for flow runs. 
You will log in a to Syntask Cloud account from the local environment where you want to run a flow.

### Steps 

1. Open a new terminal session.
2. [Install Syntask](/3.0/get-started/install/) in the environment where you want to execute flow runs.

```bash
pip install -U syntask
```

3. Use the `syntask cloud login` Syntask CLI command to log into Syntask Cloud from your environment.

```bash
syntask cloud login
```

The `syntask cloud login` command provides an interactive login experience. 

```bash
syntask cloud login
```

```bash
? How would you like to authenticate? [Use arrows to move; enter to select]
> Log in with a web browser
    Paste an API key
Paste your authentication key:
? Which workspace would you like to use? [Use arrows to move; enter to select]
> syntask/terry-syntask-workspace
    g-gadflow/g-workspace
Authenticated with Syntask Cloud! Using workspace 'syntask/terry-syntask-workspace'.
```

You can authenticate by manually pasting an [API key](/3.0/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) or through a browser-based approval that auto-generates an API key with a 30-day expiration.

### Change workspaces

To change which workspace to sync with, use the `syntask cloud workspace set` 
Syntask CLI command while logged in, passing the account handle and workspace name:

```bash
syntask cloud workspace set --workspace "syntask/my-workspace"
```

If you don't provide a workspace, you will need to select one.

**Workspace Settings** also shows you the `syntask cloud workspace set` Syntask CLI 
command to sync a local execution environment with a given workspace.

You may also use the `syntask cloud login` command with the `--workspace` or `-w` option to set the current workspace.

```bash
syntask cloud login --workspace "syntask/my-workspace"
```

## Manually configure Syntask API settings

You can manually configure the `SYNTASK_API_URL` setting to specify the Syntask Cloud API.

For Syntask Cloud, configure the `SYNTASK_API_URL` and `SYNTASK_API_KEY` settings to authenticate 
with Syntask Cloud by using an account ID, workspace ID, and API key.

```bash
syntask config set SYNTASK_API_URL="https://api.syntask.cloud/api/accounts/[ACCOUNT-ID]/workspaces/[WORKSPACE-ID]"
syntask config set SYNTASK_API_KEY="[API-KEY]"
```

When you're in a Syntask Cloud workspace, you can copy the `SYNTASK_API_URL` value directly from the page URL.

This example configures `SYNTASK_API_URL` and `SYNTASK_API_KEY` in the default profile. 
You can use `syntask profile` CLI commands to create settings profiles for different configurations. 
For example, you can configure a "cloud" profile to use the Syntask Cloud API URL and API key; 
and another "local" profile for local development using a local Syntask API server started with `syntask server start`. 
See [Settings](/3.0/manage/settings-and-profiles/) for details.

<Note>
**Environment variables**

You can set `SYNTASK_API_URL` and `SYNTASK_API_KEY` just like any other environment variable. 
See [Overriding defaults with environment variables](/3.0/manage/settings-and-profiles/) 
for more information.
</Note>

## Install requirements in execution environments

In local and remote execution environments, such as VMs and containers, ensure that you've installed any flow 
requirements or dependencies before creating a flow run.
