title: Configure settings and profiles
description: Syntask settings let you customize your workflow environment, including your Cloud and self-hosted server preferences.
---

Many of Syntask's features—especially interactions with the API—require configuration. You can configure settings through the following methods:

- **Environment Variables**: All Syntask settings can be set using environment variables prefixed with `SYNTASK_`. Environment variables are useful for temporarily overriding settings or configuring the runtime environment of a workflow. They take precedence over profile settings, making them ideal for adjustments that should only apply to a single session or process. These can also be set in a `.env` file, which will be automatically applied when using `syntask` in that directory.

- **Profiles**: Syntask profiles store sets of settings locally on your machine. When you activate a profile, its settings are applied, allowing you to switch easily between different configurations. For example, you might use one profile for a self-hosted Syntask server and another for Syntask Cloud.

To view all available settings and their active values from the command line, run:

```bash
syntask config view --show-defaults
```

These settings are type-validated and you may verify your setup at any time with:

```bash
syntask config validate
```

## Manage profiles

Syntask profiles are persisted groups of settings on your local machine. 
By default these settings are stored in a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file located at `~/.syntask/profiles.toml`.
This location can be configured by setting `SYNTASK_PROFILES_PATH`.

One and only one profile can be active at any time.

Immediately after installation, the `ephemeral` profile will be used, which only has 1 setting configured:
```bash
» docker run -it synopkg/syntask:3-latest
  ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ _____
 | _ \ _ \ __| __| __/ __|_   _|
 |  _/   / _|| _|| _| (__  | |
 |_| |_|_\___|_| |___\___| |_|


root@e56e34ab8934:/opt/syntask $ syntask config view
SYNTASK_PROFILE='ephemeral'
SYNTASK_SERVER_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL_MODE='True' (from profile)
```

<Tip>
**What is `SYNTASK_SERVER_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL_MODE`?**

This setting allows a Syntask server to be run ephemerally as needed without explicitly starting a server process.
</Tip>

The `syntask profile` CLI commands enable you to create, review, and manage profiles:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `create` | Create a new profile; use the `--from` flag to copy settings from another profile. |
| `delete` | Delete the given profile. |
| `inspect` | Display settings from a given profile; defaults to active. |
| `ls` | List all profile names. |
| `rename` | Change the name of a profile. |
| `use` | Switch the active profile. |
| `populate-defaults` | Populate your `profiles.toml` file with opinionated stock profiles. |

... or you may edit your `profiles.toml` file directly:
```bash
vim ~/.syntask/profiles.toml
```

### Configure settings for the active profile

The `syntask config` CLI commands enable you to manage the settings within the currently active profile.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| set | Change the value for a setting. |
| unset | Restore the default value for a setting. |
| view | Display the current settings. |

For example, the following CLI commands set configuration in the `ephemeral` profile and then create a new
profile with new settings:

```bash
syntask profile use ephemeral
syntask config set SYNTASK_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api

syntask profile create new-profile --from ephemeral
syntask profile use new-profile
syntask config set SYNTASK_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT=true SYNTASK_LOGGING_LEVEL="ERROR"

syntask profile inspect
syntask config unset SYNTASK_LOGGING_LEVEL -y
```

### Use environment variables

All settings can be overridden by setting the environment variable directly.

#### Override a setting for a single command
For example, we can temporarily set the logging level through an environment variable so that it 
only lasts for the duration of the command:

```bash
SYNTASK_LOGGING_LEVEL="CRITICAL" syntask config view --show-sources
```

#### Override settings in a `.env` file

You can also set environment variables in a `.env` file, which will be automatically applied when using `syntask` in that directory.

```bash
echo 'SYNTASK_LOGGING_LEVEL="CRITICAL"' > .env
syntask config view --show-sources
```

<Tip>
**Environment variables always take precedence**

Environment variables always take precedence over values stored within a profile.
This allows you to configure certain runtime behavior for your workflows by setting the appropriate
environment variable on the job or process executing the workflow.

## Commonly configured settings

This section describes some commonly configured settings. 

### Syntask Cloud

- **`SYNTASK_API_KEY`**: this setting specifies the 
[API key](/3.0/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) used to authenticate with Syntask Cloud.
- **`SYNTASK_API_URL`**: this setting specifies the API endpoint of your 
Syntask Cloud workspace or a self-hosted Syntask server instance.

<Tip>
**Use `syntask cloud login` to set these values for Syntask Cloud**

To set the `SYNTASK_API_URL` and `SYNTASK_API_KEY` for your active profile, run `syntask cloud login`. 
Read more about [managing API keys](/3.0/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/). 
</Tip>

### Syntask server

- **`SYNTASK_HOME`**: the `SYNTASK_HOME` value specifies the local Syntask directory for configuration files,
profiles, and the location of the default Syntask SQLite database.
- **`SYNTASK_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL`**: the database connection URL for a self-hosted Syntask server instance.
Must be provided in a SQLAlchemy-compatible format. Syntask currently supports SQLite and Postgres. 

## Security settings

### Host the UI behind a reverse proxy

When using a reverse proxy (such as [Nginx](https://nginx.org) or [Traefik](https://traefik.io)) to proxy traffic to a 
 hosted Syntask UI instance, you must also configure the self-hosted Syntask server instance to connect to the API. 
The SYNTASK_UI_API_URL should be set to the external proxy URL.

For example, if your external URL is `https://syntask-server.example.com` then set 
`SYNTASK_UI_API_URL=https://syntask-server.example.com/api` for the Syntask server process.
You can also set `SYNTASK_API_URL` to the API URL. 

This setting is a fallback if `SYNTASK_UI_API_URL` is not set.

### CSRF protection settings

If using self-hosted Syntask server, you can configure CSRF protection settings.

- **`SYNTASK_SERVER_CSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED`**: activates CSRF protection on the server, 
requiring valid CSRF tokens for applicable requests. Recommended for production to prevent CSRF attacks. 
Defaults to `False`.
- **`SYNTASK_SERVER_CSRF_TOKEN_EXPIRATION`**: sets the expiration duration for server-issued CSRF tokens, 
influencing how often tokens need to be refreshed. The default is 1 hour.
- **`SYNTASK_CLIENT_CSRF_SUPPORT_ENABLED`**: enables or disables CSRF token handling in the Syntask client. 
When enabled, the client manages CSRF tokens for state-changing API requests. Defaults to `True`.

By default clients expect that CSRF protection is enabled on the server. If you are running a server without CSRF protection, 
you can disable CSRF support in the client.
