title: Install Syntask 
---

import Installation from '/snippets/installation.mdx'

Syntask is published as a Python package, which requires Python 3.9 or newer. We recommend installing Syntask in a Python virtual environment. 

<Installation />

To confirm that Syntask was installed successfully, run:

```bash
syntask version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
Version:             3.0.0
API version:         0.8.4
Python version:      3.12.2
Git commit:          d6bdb075
Built:               Thu, Apr 11, 2024 6:58 PM
OS/Arch:             darwin/arm64
Profile:              local
Server type:         ephemeral
Server:
  Database:          sqlite
  SQLite version:    3.45.2
```

## Windows installation

You can install and run Syntask via Windows PowerShell, the Windows Command Prompt, or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html). After installation, you may need to manually add the Python local packages `Scripts` folder to your `Path` environment variable.

The `Scripts` folder path looks something like:

```bash
C:\Users\MyUserNameHere\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python311\Scripts
```

Review the `pip install` output messages for the `Scripts` folder path on your system.

## Minimal Syntask installation

The `syntask-client` library is a minimal installation of Syntask designed for interacting with Syntask Cloud or a remote self-hosted Syntask server instance.

`syntask-client` enables a subset of Syntask's capabilities with a smaller installation size, making it ideal for use in lightweight, resource-constrained, or ephemeral environments.
It omits all CLI and server components found in the `syntask` library.

To install the latest release of `syntask-client`, run:

```bash
pip install -U syntask-client
```

## Next steps

You also need an API server, either:

* [Syntask Cloud](/3.0/manage/cloud/), a managed solution that provides strong scaling, performance, and security, or
* [Self-hosted Syntask server](/3.0/manage/self-host/), an API server that you run on your own infrastructure where you are responsible for scaling and any authentication and authorization.

Now that you have Syntask installed, go through the [quickstart](/3.0/get-started/quickstart/) to try it out.

Learn more about release versions in the [Syntask release notes](https://github.com/synopkg/syntask/releases).

See our [Contributing docs](/contribute/dev-contribute/) for instructions on installing Syntask for development.
