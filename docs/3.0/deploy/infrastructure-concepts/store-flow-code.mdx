title: Retrieve code from storage
description: Learn about where to store your flow code.
---

When a deployment runs, the execution environment needs access to the flow code.
Flow code is not stored in Syntask server or Syntask Cloud.

You have several flow code storage options for remote execution:
- Git-based storage (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Docker image-based storage
- Cloud-provider storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP GCS)

Each of these options is popular - your choice will depend upon your team's needs and tools.

Local storage is also an option for deployments that run locally.

In the examples below, we show how to create a work pool-based deployment for each of these storage options. 

## Deployment creation options
You can create a deployment through [Python code with the `flow.deploy` method](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/deploy-via-python) or through a [YAML specification defined in a `syntask.yaml` file](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/syntask-yaml).

When using the Python `deploy` method specify a flow storage location other than a Docker image requires the `flow.from_source` method. The `source` and `entrypoint` arguments are required. 

The `entrypoint` is the path to the file the flow is located in and the function name, separated by a colon.

The `source` is either a URL to a git repository or a storage object.

To create a `syntask.yaml` file interactively, run `syntask deploy` from the CLI and select the appropriate storage option.

## Git-based storage

Git-based version control platforms provide redundancy, version control, and collaboration capabilities. Syntask supports:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

For a public repository, you can use the repository URL directly.

If you are using a private repository and are authenticated in your environment at deployment creation and deployment execution, you can use the repository URL directly.

Alternatively, for a private repository, you can create a `Secret` block or create a credentials block specific to your git-based version control platform to store your credentials. 
Then you can reference the block in the Python `deploy` method or the `syntask.yaml` file pull step.

If using the Python `deploy` method with a private repository that references a block, provide a [`GitRepository`](https://syntask-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/syntask/flows/#syntask.runner.storage.GitRepository) object instead of a URL, as shown below.

    </CodeGroup>

    For accessing a private repository, we suggest creating a personal access token.
    We recommend using HTTPS with [fine-grained Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) to limit access by repository. 
    
    See the GitHub docs for [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

    Under *Your Profile -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained token* choose *Generate New Token* and 
    fill in the required fields. 
    
    Under *Repository access* choose *Only select repositories* and grant the token permissions for *Contents*.

    If using a Secret block, you can create it through code or the UI ahead of time and reference it at deployment creation as shown above. 

    If using a credentials block, you can create it ahead of time and reference it at deployment creation. 

    1. Install syntask-github with `pip install -U syntask-github`
    1. Register the blocks in that library to make them available on the server with `syntask block register -m syntask_github`
    1. Create a GitHub Credentials block through code or the Syntask UI and reference it at deployment creation as shown above.

    For accessing a private repository, we recommend using HTTPS with Repository, Project, or Workspace [Access Tokens](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/access-tokens/). 
    
    You can create a Repository Access Token with Scopes -> Repositories -> Read.

    Bitbucket requires you prepend the token string with `x-token-auth:` The full string looks like this: `x-token-auth:abc_123_this_is_a_token`. 

    If using a Secret block, you can create it through code or the UI ahead of time and reference it at deployment creation as shown above. 

    If using a credentials block, you can create it ahead of time and reference it at deployment creation.

    For accessing a private repository, we recommend using HTTPS with [Project Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

    In your repository in the GitLab UI, select *Settings -> Repository -> Project Access Tokens* and check 
    *read_repository* under *Select scopes*.

    If using a Secret block, you can create it through code or the UI ahead of time and reference it at deployment creation as shown above. 

    If using a credentials block, you can create it ahead of time and reference it at deployment creation. 

    1. Install syntask-gitlab with `pip install -U syntask-gitlab`
    1. Register the blocks in that library with `syntask block register -m syntask_gitlab` 
    1. Create a GitLab credentials block in code or the Syntask UI and reference it at deployment creation as shown above.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Note that you can specify a `branch` if creating a `GitRepository` object. 
The default is `"main"`.

<Warning>
**Push your code**

When you make a change to your code, Syntask does not push your code to your git-based version control platform.
You need to push your code manually or as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
This is intentional to avoid confusion about the git history and push process.
</Warning>

## Docker-based storage

Another popular flow code storage option is to include it in a Docker image. 
All work pool options except **Process** and **Syntask Managed** allow you to bake your code into a Docker image.

To create a deployment with Docker-based flow code storage use the Python `deploy` method or create a `syntask.yaml` file.

<Note>
If you use the Python `deploy` method to store the flow code in a Docker image, you don't need to use the `from_source` method.
</Note>

The `syntask.yaml` file below was generated by running `syntask deploy` from the CLI (a few lines of metadata were excluded from the top of the file output for brevity).

Note that the `build` section is necessary if baking your flow code into a Docker image.

<CodeGroup>

```python docker_deploy.py
from syntask import flow


@flow
def my_flow():
    print("Hello from inside a Docker container!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow.deploy(
        name="my-docker-deploy",
        work_pool_name="my_pool",
        image="my-docker-image:latest",
    )
```

```yaml syntask.yaml
# build section allows you to manage and build docker images
build:
- syntask_docker.deployments.steps.build_docker_image:
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.3.1
    id: build-image
    dockerfile: auto
    image_name: my_username/default
    tag: latest

# push section allows you to manage if and how this project is uploaded to remote locations
push: null

# pull section allows you to provide instructions for cloning this project in remote locations
pull:
- syntask.deployments.steps.set_working_directory:
    directory: /opt/syntask/my_directory


# the deployments section allows you to provide configuration for deploying flows
deployments:
- name: my-docker-deployment
  version: null
  tags: []
  concurrency_limit: null
  description: null
  entrypoint: my_file.py:my_flow
  parameters: {}
  work_pool:
    name: my_pool
    work_queue_name: null
    job_variables:
      image: '{{ build-image.image }}'
  enforce_parameter_schema: true
  schedules: []

```
</CodeGroup>

Any pip packages specified in a `requirements.txt` file will be included in the image.

In the examples above, we elected not to push the image to a remote registry.

To push the image to a remote registry, pass `push=True` in the Python `deploy` method or change `push: true` in the `syntask.yaml` file.

### Custom Docker image

By default, your deployment will use the base Syntask image when creating your image.
Alternatively, you can create a custom Docker image outside of Syntask. 
If doing this with and you don't need push or pull steps in the `syntask.yaml` file.
Instead, the work pool can reference the image directly.

For more information, see [this discussion of custom Docker images](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-examples/docker/#automatically-build-a-custom-docker-image-with-a-local-dockerfile).

## Cloud-provider storage

Another option for flow code storage is any [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-supported storage location, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or GCP GCS.

If the storage location is publicly available, or if you are authenticated in the environment where you are creating and running your deployment, you can reference the storage location directly. 
You don't need to pass credentials explicitly.

To pass credentials explicitly to authenticate to your storage location, you can use either of the following block types:

- Syntask integration library storage blocks, such as the `prefect-aws` library's `S3Bucket` block, which can use a `AWSCredentials` block when it is created.
- Secret blocks

<Note>
If you use a storage block such as the `S3Bucket` block, you need to have the `prefect-aws` library available in the environment where your flow code runs.

You can do any of the following to make the library available:

1. Install the library into the execution environment directly
1. Specify the library in the work pool's Base Job Template in the **Environment Variables** section like this:`{"EXTRA_PIP_PACKAGES":"prefect-aws"}`
1. Specify the library in the environment variables of the `deploy` method as shown in the examples below
1. Specify the library in a `requirements.txt` file and reference the file in the `pull` step of the `syntask.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
    - syntask.deployments.steps.pip_install_requirements:
        directory: "{{ pull_code.directory }}" 
        requirements_file: requirements.txt
```

</Note>

The examples below show how to create a deployment with flow code in a cloud provider storage location.
For each example, we show how to access code that is publicly available.
The `syntask.yaml` example includes an additional line to reference a credentials block if authenticating to a private storage location through that option. 

We also include Python code that shows how to use an existing storage block and an example of that creates, but doesn't save, a storage block that references an existing nested credentials block.

    To create an `AwsCredentials` block:

    1. Install the [prefect-aws](https://synopkg.github.io/prefect-aws/) library with `pip install -U prefect-aws`
    1. Register the blocks in prefect-aws with `syntask block register -m prefect_aws` 
    1. Create a user with a role with read and write permissions to access the bucket. If using the UI, create an access key pair with *IAM -> Users -> Security credentials -> Access keys -> Create access key*. Choose *Use case -> Other* and then copy the *Access key* and *Secret access key* values.
    1. Create an [`AWSCredentials` block](/integrations/prefect-aws/index#save-credentials-to-an-aws-credentials-block) in code or the Syntask UI. In addition to the block name, most users will fill in the *AWS Access Key ID* and *AWS Access Key Secret* fields.
    1. Reference the block as shown above.

Another authentication option is to give the [worker](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/workers/) access to the storage location at runtime through SSH keys.

## Store code locally

If using a Process work pool, you can use one of the remote code storage options shown above, or you can store your flow code in a local folder.

Here is an example of how to create a deployment with flow code stored locally:

<CodeGroup>

```python local_process_deploy_local_code.py
from syntask import flow
from pathlib import Path


@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow(name: str = "World"):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")
    print(str(Path(__file__).parent))  # dynamic path


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow.from_source(
        source=str(Path(__file__).parent),  # code stored in local directory
        entrypoint="local_process_deploy_local_code.py:my_flow",
    ).deploy(
        name="local-process-deploy-local-code",
        work_pool_name="my-process-pool",
    )
```

```yaml syntask.yaml
build: null

push: null

pull:
- syntask.deployments.steps.set_working_directory:
    directory: /my_directory

deployments:
- name: local-process-deploy-local-code
  version: null
  tags: []
  concurrency_limit: null
  description: null
  entrypoint: local_process_deploy_local_code.py:my_flow
  parameters: {}
  work_pool:
    name: my-process-pool
    work_queue_name: null
    job_variables: {}
  enforce_parameter_schema: true
  schedules: []
```
</CodeGroup>

## Include or exclude files from storage

By default, Syntask includes all files in the current folder when you create a deployment.

When using a git repository, Docker image, or cloud-provider storage location, you may want to exclude certain files or directories. 
If you are familiar with Docker you are likely familiar with the [`.dockerignore`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) file. 
For remote storage, the `.syntaskignore` file serves the same purpose and follows a similar syntax. 
For example, an entry of `*.pyc` will exclude all `.pyc` files from upload.

## Update flow code

After creating a deployment, you may need to change your flow code.
If baking your flow code into a Docker image, you will need to rebuild your image.
If storing your flow code in a git-based version control platform or a cloud-based storage location, often you can update your flow code without rebuilding your deployment.

The exception is when something the server needs to know about has changed, such as the flow entrypoint parameters.

Rerun the Python script with `deploy` or run `syntask deploy` from the CLI for YAML-based deployments to update your deployment with the new flow code.

## Flow code storage for deployments created with `serve` 

The Python `serve` method creates a deployment and a local long-running process to poll for flow runs at the same time.

The deployment creation mechanics for `serve` are similar to `deploy`. 
`deploy`just requires a work pool name and has a number of parameters dealing with flow code storage for Docker images.

Unlike `serve`, if you don't specify an image to use for your flow, you must specify where to pull the flow code from at runtime with the `from_source` method; `from_source` is optional with `serve`.

Read more about when to consider using `serve` [here](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/deploy-via-python#when-to-consider-flow-deploy-over-flow-serve).
