`syntask-azure` makes it easy to leverage the capabilities of Azure in your workflows.
For example, you can retrieve secrets, read and write Blob Storage objects, and deploy your flows on Azure Container Instances (ACI).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and the necessary permissions to access desired services.

### Install `syntask-azure`

The following command will install a version of `syntask-azure` compatible with your installed version of `syntask`.
If you don't already have `syntask` installed, it will install the newest version of `syntask` as well.

```bash
pip install "syntask[azure]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `syntask` and `syntask-azure`:

```bash
pip install -U "syntask[azure]"
```

If necessary, see [additional installation options for Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, and ML Datastore](#additional-installation-options).

To install syntask-azure with all additional capabilities, run the install command above and then run the following command:

```bash
pip install "syntask-azure[all_extras]"
```

### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the module to make them available for use.

```bash
syntask block register -m syntask_azure
```

## Examples

### Download a blob

```python
from syntask import flow

from syntask_azure import AzureBlobStorageCredentials
from syntask_azure.blob_storage import blob_storage_download

@flow
def example_blob_storage_download_flow():
    connection_string = "connection_string"
    blob_storage_credentials = AzureBlobStorageCredentials(
        connection_string=connection_string,
    )
    data = blob_storage_download(
        blob="syntask.txt",
        container="syntask",
        blob_storage_credentials=blob_storage_credentials,
    )
    return data

example_blob_storage_download_flow()
```

Use `with_options` to customize options on any existing task or flow:

```python
custom_blob_storage_download_flow = example_blob_storage_download_flow.with_options(
    name="My custom task name",
    retries=2,
    retry_delay_seconds=10,
)
```

### Run flows on Azure Container Instances

Run flows on [Azure Container Instances (ACI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/) to dynamically scale your infrastructure.

See the [Azure Container Instances Worker Guide](/integrations/syntask-azure/aci_worker/) for a walkthrough of using ACI in a hybrid work pool.

If you're using Syntask Cloud, [ACI push work pools](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-examples/serverless/#__tabbed_1_2) provide all the benefits of ACI with a quick setup and no worker needed.

## Resources

For assistance using Azure, consult the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure).

Refer to the `syntask-azure` API documentation linked in the sidebar to explore all the capabilities of the `syntask-azure` library.

### Additional installation options

First install the main library compatible with your `syntask` version:

```bash
pip install "syntask[azure]"
```

Then install the additional capabilities you need.

To use Blob Storage:

```bash
pip install "syntask-azure[blob_storage]"
```

To use Cosmos DB:

```bash
pip install "syntask-azure[cosmos_db]"
```

To use ML Datastore:

```bash
pip install "syntask-azure[ml_datastore]"
```
