Integrations to extend Syntask's functionality with Redis.

## Getting started

### Install `syntask-redis`

The following command will install a version of `syntask-redis` compatible with your installed version of `syntask`. 
If you don't already have `syntask` installed, it will install the newest version of `syntask` as well.

```bash
pip install "syntask[redis]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `syntask` and `syntask-redis`:

```bash
pip install -U "syntask[redis]"
```

### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the `syntask-redis` module to make them available for use.

```bash
syntask block register -m syntask_redis
```
