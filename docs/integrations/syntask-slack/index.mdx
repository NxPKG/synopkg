## Welcome!

`syntask-slack` is a collection of prebuilt Syntask tasks that can be used to quickly construct Syntask flows.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

A Slack account with permissions to create a Slack app and install it in your workspace.

### Installation

The following command will install a version of `syntask-slack` compatible with your installed version of `syntask`. 
If you don't already have `syntask` installed, it will install the newest version of `syntask` as well.

```bash
pip install "syntask[slack]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `syntask` and `syntask-slack`:

```bash
pip install -U "syntask[slack]"
```

### Slack setup

To use tasks in the package, create a Slack app and install it in your Slack workspace. You can create a Slack app by navigating to the [apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps) for your Slack account and selecting 'Create New App'.

For tasks that require a Bot user OAuth token, you can get a token for your app by navigating to your app's __OAuth & Permissions__ page.

For tasks that require a Webhook URL, you can generate a new Webhook URL by navigating to you apps __Incoming Webhooks__ page.

Slack's [Basic app setup](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics) guide provides additional details on setting up a Slack app.

### Write and run a flow

```python
from syntask import flow
from syntask.context import get_run_context
from syntask_slack import SlackCredentials
from syntask_slack.messages import send_chat_message


@flow
def example_send_message_flow():
   context = get_run_context()

   # Run other tasks or flows here

   token = "xoxb-your-bot-token-here"
   send_chat_message(
         slack_credentials=SlackCredentials(token),
         channel="#syntask",
         text=f"Flow run {context.flow_run.name} completed :tada:"
   )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_send_message_flow()
```
