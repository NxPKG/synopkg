The `syntask-email` library helps you send emails from your Syntask flows.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Many email services, such as Gmail, require an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) to successfully send emails.
    If you encounter an error similar to `smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError: (535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted...`, it's likely you are not using an App Password.

### Install `syntask-email`

The following command will install a version of syntask-email compatible with your installed version of Syntask. 
If you don't already have Syntask installed, it will install the newest version of Syntask as well.

```bash
pip install "syntask[email]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of Syntask and syntask-email:

```bash
pip install -U "syntask[email]"
```

### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the syntask-email module to make them available for use.

```bash
syntask block register -m syntask_email
```

## Save credentials to an EmailServerCredentials block

Save your email credentials to a block.
Replace the placeholders with your email address and password.

```python
from syntask_email import EmailServerCredentials


credentials = EmailServerCredentials(
    username="EMAIL-ADDRESS-PLACEHOLDER",
    password="PASSWORD-PLACEHOLDER",  # must be an application password
)
credentials.save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

In the examples below you load a credentials block to authenticate with the email server.

## Send emails

The code below shows how to send an email using the pre-built `email_send_message` [task](https://docs.syntask.khulnasoft.com/latest/develop/write-tasks/).

```python
from syntask import flow
from syntask_email import EmailServerCredentials, email_send_message


@flow
def example_email_send_message_flow(email_addresses):
    email_server_credentials = EmailServerCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    for email_address in email_addresses:
        subject = email_send_message.with_options(name=f"email {email_address}").submit(
            email_server_credentials=email_server_credentials,
            subject="Example Flow Notification using Gmail",
            msg="This proves email_send_message works!",
            email_to=email_address,
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_email_send_message_flow(["EMAIL-ADDRESS-PLACEHOLDER"])
```

## Capture exceptions and send an email

This example demonstrates how to send an email notification with the details of the exception when a flow run fails.

`syntask-email` can be wrapped in an `except` statement to do just that!

```python
from syntask import flow
from syntask.context import get_run_context
from syntask_email import EmailServerCredentials, email_send_message


def notify_exc_by_email(exc):
    context = get_run_context()
    flow_run_name = context.flow_run.name
    email_server_credentials = EmailServerCredentials.load("email-server-credentials")
    email_send_message(
        email_server_credentials=email_server_credentials,
        subject=f"Flow run {flow_run_name!r} failed",
        msg=f"Flow run {flow_run_name!r} failed due to {exc}.",
        email_to=email_server_credentials.username,
    )

@flow
def example_flow():
    try:
        1 / 0
    except Exception as exc:
        notify_exc_by_email(exc)
        raise


if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_flow()
```
