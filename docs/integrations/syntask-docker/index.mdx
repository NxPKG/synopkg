The `prefect-docker` library is required to create deployments that will submit runs to most Syntask work pool infrastructure types.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/) and running.

### Install `prefect-docker`

The following command will install a version of `prefect-docker` compatible with your installed version of `syntask`. 
If you don't already have `syntask` installed, it will install the newest version of `syntask` as well.

```bash
pip install "syntask[docker]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `syntask` and `prefect-docker`:

```bash
pip install -U "syntask[docker]"
```
### Examples
See the Syntask [Workers docs](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-examples/docker) to learn how to create and run deployments that use Docker.

## Resources
